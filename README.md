## 🛍️ Theft & Violence in Retail Shops

- **Shrink** is the loss metric in retail due to theft or other causes.
- In 2022, retail shrink hit **$112.1 billion**, up from **$93.9 billion** in 2021.
- Theft (internal & external) makes up **65-70%** of shrink.
- **Organized Retail Crime (ORC)** has become increasingly violent.
  - **81%** report ORC offenders are more violent than previous years.
  - **67%** say violence is increasing year over year.
